/**
 * Dividing The Kingdom
 * 
 * An old king wants to divide his kingdom between his two sons. He is well known for his justness and wisdom, 
 * and he plans to make a good use of both of these attributes while dividing his kingdom. The kingdom is administratively 
 * split into square boroughs that form an N × M grid. Some of the boroughs contain gold mines. The king knows that his sons 
 * do not care as much about the land as they do about gold, so he wants both parts of the kingdom to contain exactly the same 
 * number of mines. Moreover, he wants to split the kingdom with either a horizontal or a vertical line that goes along the 
 * borders of the boroughs (splitting no borough into two parts).
 * 
 * The goal is to count how many ways he can split the kingdom.
 * 
 * Write a function:
 * function solution(N, M, X, Y); 
 * that, given two arrays of K integers X and Y, denoting coordinates of boroughs containing the gold mines, 
 * will compute the number of fair divisions of the kingdom. 
 * 
 * For example, given N = 5, M = 5, X = [0, 4, 2, 0] and Y = [0, 0, 1, 4], the function should return 3. 
 * 
 * - N and M are integers within the range [1..100,000];
 * - K is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
 * - each element of array X is an integer within the range [0..N−1];
 * - each element of array Y is an integer within the range [0..M−1].
